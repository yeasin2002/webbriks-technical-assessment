## Better Fullstack project context

`bts.jsonc` is the authority for the current Stack Graph. Its `stackParts` array owns role selection and `ownerPartId` bindings. Top-level option fields are a compatibility projection and must not become a second mutation path.

### Stack Parts, ownership, and evidence

### Installed-version authority

Use `bts.jsonc` for the generator and schema version. Use local package manifests and lockfiles for installed dependency versions. Do not assume that documentation for a newer Better Fullstack release matches this project.

### Compatibility and lifecycle safety

Run `create-better-fullstack context --json` for bounded roles, capabilities, evidence, compatibility issues, and safe next actions. Run `create-better-fullstack doctor --json` before repairing graph drift. Existing-project writes must start with a plan and use the exact review token. Use `create-better-fullstack recipes check --json` before editing recipe-owned paths or managed regions, and use recipe history plus project recovery commands to undo a reviewed operation.

User code outside an explicit Better Fullstack managed region is not generator-owned. Missing or changed managed-region hashes stop recipe planning for manual review.
